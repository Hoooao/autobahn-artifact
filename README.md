## Claims 

### General

This artifact contains, and allows to reproduce, experiments for all figures included in the paper "Autobahn: Seamless high speed BFT". 

It contains a prototype implemententation of Autobahn, as well as the reference implementations used to evaluate baseline systems: VanillaHS, BatchedHS, and Bullshark. Each prototype is located on its *own* branch, named accordingly. Please checkout the corresponding branch when validating claims for a given system.

TODO: Describe what the prototype does, and does not implement.
- e.g. its rust tokio, uses networking..
- e.g. do we have signed client messages? do we have exponential timeouts?



### Concrete claims in the paper

- **Main claim 1**: Autobahn matches the Throughput of Bullshark, while reducing latency by a factor of 2x. 

- **Main claim 2**: Autobahn avoids hangovers in the presence of blips.
